# Building NFTs on Stream

This is a repository that will hold all the information from the streams
You can watch at twitch.tv/melkeydev

## Goals

This is a simple tutorial/guide on how someone can get started building NFTs, from start to finish.
This includes generating the entire collection, having rarity traits, deploying on OpenSea, creating the contract and all the other details.
There's a lot of great resources out there, but some of them don't go into enough detail or have the ability to answer questions.
One note, is that we will assume all the art is already created by either you or another artist!

## F.A.Q

### What chain are we going to build our NFT on?

Ideally ETH, but since prices are sky high, we will use the Polygon protocol, which is a layer 2 off of ETH. The build process is the same.

### How much will this cost?

It depends. Since we are using the MATIC network, it will cost very little to deploy. The only true cost is actually spending ETH to get Matic onto the Matic network.

### Will I get rich from this?

This repository is simply just supplying you with some tools.

### Will this cover everything?

Nope, but it should get the ball rolling and allow you to search up things yourself to further improvr and learn.

### How can I support?

You can follow the stream, star this repo, join the Discord.
